        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The site purpose provides a statement about the purpose of the website drawing upon the client's functional
            specifications, the industry and any fictitious but viable goals that you deem to be reasonable for a
            community site that provides weather information.
            The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website in describing what services it provides.
            Typically students might leave this section lacking by not talking about perceived content objectives.
