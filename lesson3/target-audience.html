            <p>
                This section requires some research about the website visitors by looking into the purpose and the
                industry,
                visiting similar sites and preforming surveys to discover what scenarios are relevant to the visitor.
                Develop two personas to describe the target audience for the weather site. This section should describe
                the
                target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.
