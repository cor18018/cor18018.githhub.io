            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

            <p>Shutterstock uses the principle of the Rule of Thirds by placing its icons and buttons in the center and on
                the edges of the screen. Stutterstock also has each section devided up into sections that align with the vertical 
                and horizontal lines that make up the Rule of Thirds.

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <img src="lesson_images/pinterest.JPG" alt="pinterest_image"/>
            <p class="link"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></p>
            <p>Pinterest uses the design principle of white space and clean design very well by evenly and
                consistently spacing out its images and pages. Even with images that are different sizes
                they all are spaced in a specific way and as you scroll through it each alternating image catches your eye.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <img src="lesson_images/amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon"/>
            <p class="link"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></p>
            <p>Amazon is a perfect example of Hick's Law as it has so many different items to choose from
                as well as buttons that can show you even more items. You can even search for specific items
                and all of this keeps you on their sight and increases the chance that you will buy something from them.
